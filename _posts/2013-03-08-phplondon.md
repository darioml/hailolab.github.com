I spoke at [PHP London](http://www.meetup.com/phplondon/events/70633952/) last night on "Deploying Distributed Systems". The slides are below.

>Deploying a PHP application is often a simple process, but as the complexity of an application grows this can become significantly more complicated. A number of tools exist to manage this process, one of which is Capistrano. In this talk we'll look at how Capistrano can easily and reliably deploy anything from a simple website to multi-server globally distributed systems, how simple customisation can extend its capabilities, and if alternatives are preferable with globally distributed architectures.
