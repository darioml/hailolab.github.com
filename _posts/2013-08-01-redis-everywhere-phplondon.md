I spoke at [PHP London](http://www.meetup.com/phplondon/events/70634232/) on "Redis Everywhere". The slides and recorded video are below.

>Redis is an extremely fast data structure server that can be easily added to your existing stack and act like a Swiss army knife to help solve many problems that would be extremely difficult to workaround with the traditional RDBMS. This talk covers an introduction to Redis, how we can use it in our PHP applications and some advanced use cases beyond the most known ones, which are probably Caching and Session Management. There are also some war stories from my time at SocialPoint, a video gaming company based in Barcelona where Redis is used extensively for projects like DragonCity that has to deal with more than 7 million daily users.
